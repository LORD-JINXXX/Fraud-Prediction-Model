# Fraud-Prediction-Model
This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and use insights from the model to develop an 
actionable plan.
Following usual model development procedures, the model would be estimated on the calibration data and tested on the validation data. This case requires both 
statistical analysis and creativity/judgment.
